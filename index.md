## Hello, there 
I'm Lily, a Robotics and Autonomous Systems Masters Student at [Arizona State University](https://sites.google.com/view/asuneurorobotics/). I'll be graduating in December having defended my thesis on the development of [A Soft Robotic Hip Exosuit for Rehabiliation and Gait Assistance](https://www.researchgate.net/project/Hip-Exosuit-for-Gait-Rehabilitation/). I'm passionate about using robotics to improve our world - creating safer working conditions, exploring dangerous environments, improving surgical outcomes, and advancing rehabilitation capabilities. 
When I'm not in the lab, you'll likely find me hiking, trying out local restaurants, or salsa dancing (or teaching it!).
